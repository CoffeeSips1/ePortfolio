## Introduction

This ePortfolio showcases the knowledge and skills I acquired during my Computer Science studies at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It reflects my growth in the program and <a href='https://meritpages.com/coffeesips1'>honors</a> earned throughout.


## Professional Self Assessment

My journey through the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) has been marked by a series of challenging projects and opportunities for growth that have collectively honed my skillset as a software engineer. Among these, my portfolio project, the development of an enhanced full-stack web application, stands out as a testament to my competence and employability in the field.

The transformation of a CLI-based software into a comprehensive full-stack web application underscores my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. Utilizing Microsoft's .NET and Entity Frameworks, I connected the application to an MSSQL database, enabling it to scale and utilize dynamic data. This project serves as a compelling demonstration of my extensive capabilities in software engineering and database management. By selecting an original artifact from a challenging course project, I showcased my ability to understand and reverse engineer compiled machine code, enhance basic applications, and integrate robust database solutions in a secure manor. My approach reflects my dedication to advancing my skillset and my readiness to tackle complex software design and implementation tasks in a professional setting.

Collaboration is a cornerstone of effective software development, and throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to work effectively within team environments. By engaging with my peers and my instructors, I have fostered collaborative environments that support decision-making and innovation. My approach to teamwork is rooted in mutual respect, active listening, and a collaborative mindset, which enables me to contribute positively to any team dynamic. This is further reflected in the tutoring I offered to fellow classmates as we collaborated with the completion of various course materials

Security is a priority in my development process, and I consistently integrate measures to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate design flaws through secure coding practices and regular reviews. My portfolio project demonstrates my commitment to implementing security best practices, ensuring that applications are resilient against threats and attacks. By adopting a proactive approach to security, I have positioned myself as a responsible and forward-thinking software engineer, ready to contribute to the development of secure and reliable software solutions.

## Portfolio Enhancement Project - Introduction & Narrative

For my portfolio project, I had to make three improvements to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer. My improvements were to demonstrate advancements in software design, databases, algorithms and data structures. This is an overview of what I chose, why I chose it and the various improvements I made to the original project to reflect my skillset as a software engineer.

</blockquote>

I selected an original artifact for enhancement that stemmed from a project I undertook during the CS-410 course from my degree program. In CS-410, we were tasked with reverse engineering fully compiled machine code into an uncompiled state using C++. I decided to extend this project by transforming the initial CLI-based software into a comprehensive full-stack web application. Utilizing Microsoft's .NET and Entity Frameworks, I connected the application to an MSSQL database enabling the application to scale and utilize dynamic data.

This project serves as a compelling demonstration of my extensive capabilities as a software engineer. By selecting an original artifact from a challenging course project, I showcased my ability to not only understand and reverse engineer compiled machine code but also to enhance a basic CLI application into a sophisticated full-stack web application. The use of Microsoft's .NET and Entity Frameworks, along with the integration of an MSSQL database, underscores my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. This choice reflects my dedication to advancing my skills and my readiness to tackle complex software design and implementation tasks in a professional setting.

In reflection, I found that enhancing my project from a previous course was simple thanks to my confidence and experience with similar tasks. I keep old project files handy to reuse modular code, streamlining the implementation of similar functions. This approach allows me to quickly create secure applications using templates from prior works and enables my continual improvement process which involves enhancing related works based on learnings from working on code.


## Portfolio Enhancement Project - Code Review

Code reviews are essential components of software development, but it is important to avoid continuous optimization that may prevent the delivery of a final product.

<blockquote style="font-size: 20px;">
    <em>“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”</em>
    <p style="text-align: right;">- Donald Knuth</p>
</blockquote>

Code reviews ensure quality assurance for our project code and usually help software engineers to identify critical bugs and points of optimization. Despite the stigma about code reviews that details how they are unnecessary and bureaucratic, I choose to observe code reviews from a different angle. In a previous class I attended taught by Harvard professor David J. Malan, I learned about a process called rubber duck debugging. If you've never heard of it before, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in a spoken or written natural language. People often do this by talking to themselves or explaining a problem to a peer and through the process of talking through the problem, self-solving for a solution. A code review operates in much the same way and provides a systematic examination of the computer source code, to identify and improve inflections within the source.


## Portfolio Enhancement Project - Overview

Reviewing the revised project, it is completely different to the original CLI based app. The new web-based app offers the ability to make changes to customers that are persistant thanks to the design and implementation of a MSSQL back-end database...

You can download and run both the original and redesigned project from <a href='https://github.com/CoffeeSips1/ePortfolio'>this</a> Github repo.

To run this project as is you will need a local MSSQL instance (express is free). Additionally note the default username and password stored in the config file: 
admin / admin

Changing the password in the configuration file is secure as the application will automatically encrypt the password and update the config file protecting the clear-text password from a potential breach.
